port: 13370

sync_server: "ws://localhost:13371" #this is basically the services server. but its not! this is what the client server will internally use to retrieve its configs and shit. in theory the sync server could put in a different services URL entirely! anyway, if the client and services servers are both running on the same machine, you can keep this as localhost.

this_url: "legacyshell.com" #used in some find and replaces. input the url you want people to access your site via.
