# Removed Content

There are a number of things created for Shell which have been removed over the course of the game's life.

## Stamps

### The "Sex" Stamp

This is a stamp displaying a pair of breasts and female pubic hair.

It wasn't ever released to the public and is likely just a very tasteless joke by the devs while they were making teams mode, or something.

It was removed around 2020 and replaced by the BWD logo:

Does it need explaining why this was removed?

## The Chicken Middle Stamp

This is a stamp showing a middle finger.

It was replaced by the Lyerpald Stamp:

This itself is a duplicate, and only exists to cover up the horrifying past.

Again, not much explanation is needed for its removal. This was however actually distributed.
