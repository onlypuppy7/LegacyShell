In the game, the Piper is hinted at by a message in the Castle Dinost dungeon. The message reads:
> *"Piper's pillar, the hardest for thee, kneel behind his mark til the Piper you see."*

The pillar mentioned in the message refers to one of the pillars in the castle's garden. It has a *p* on the middle.

In the background, the Piper can be seen as a statue too.

By repeatedly kneeling behind the pillar, the game will enter the battle.

## The bossfight
- The Piper's fight uses Castle Dinost's battle background.
- The boss is depicted flying in the battle.
- The fight uses the song *"Dark Cloud"* by *Flying Hands*, labeled as ["*bigboss2*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUlMdb_Hd0) in the game files.

## Beating the Piper
The Piper's stats are incredibly overpowered. In fact, the boss is so hard, it has taken 16 years for someone to beat it while recording. The [first recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMj5otPN3xA) of someone beating the Piper was released on the ninth of March 2024 by [MrMcCowLicks](https://www.youtube.com/@MrMcCowLicks) on youtube.
