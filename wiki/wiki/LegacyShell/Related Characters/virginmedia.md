## The outage
### The beginning
The creator of LegacyShell, *onlypuppy7*, is a customer of Virgin Media. On the 17th of December 2024, his internet went out. Due to all of LegacyShell's services being self-hosted, the entire LegacyShell project went offline as a result, as well as his personal website [*onlypuppy7.online*](https://www.onlypuppy7.online/).

### The bomb threat
As a result of the outage, onlypuppy7 and other angry LegacyShell players decided to write a bomb threat to the Virgin Media HQ with help of uncensored offline AI models puppy had downloaded.

### The end
Due to the bomb threat, Virgin Media agreed to send a technician on the next friday, the 20th of December, to investigate the issue. As it turns out, an engineer from the company had broken cables while working on something else. The technitian was able to resolve the issue.
At 5:41 PM CET, onlypuppy announced via a post in the [annoucements](https://discord.com/channels/1274473018407780393/1274473560433492049/1319706261989621872)-channel of the Legacyshell discord, that the issue had been fixed and he would be working on getting the services back online.
At 7:11 PM CET, it was announces that all of the services had returned back to functional, including the [LegacyShell website](https://www.legacyshell.com), the [LegacyShell forum](https://forum.onlypuppy7.online/viewforum.php?f=6) and the self-hosted LegacyShell music bot.
