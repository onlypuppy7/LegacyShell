## The December 2024 Outage

### The beginning
The creator of LegacyShell, *onlypuppy7*, is a customer of Virgin Media. On the 17th of December 2024, his internet went out. Due to all of LegacyShell's services being self-hosted, the entire LegacyShell project went offline as a result, as well as his personal website [*onlypuppy7.online*](https://www.onlypuppy7.online/).

### The bomb threat
As a result of the outage, onlypuppy7 and other angry LegacyShell players decided to write a bomb threat (in minecraft) to the Virgin Media HQ with help of uncensored offline AI models puppy had downloaded.

### The end
Due to the (in minecraft) bomb threat, Virgin Media agreed to send a technician on the next friday, the 20th of December, to investigate the issue. As it turns out, an engineer from the company had broken cables while working on something else. The technician was able to resolve the issue.
At 5:41 PM CET, onlypuppy announced via a post in the [announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1274473018407780393/1274473560433492049/1319706261989621872)-channel of the Legacyshell discord, that the issue had been fixed and he would be working on getting the services back online.
At 7:11 PM CET, it was announced that all of the services had returned back to functional, including the [LegacyShell website](https://www.legacyshell.com), the [LegacyShell forum](https://forum.onlypuppy7.online/viewforum.php?f=6) and the self-hosted LegacyShell music bot. A code for 10000 eggs with three uses had been included in the message as well.

## The February 2025 Outage

### The beginning

Starting on the [25th of February](https://discord.com/channels/1274473018407780393/1274473560433492049/1344016152380182590), onlypuppy began having issues with his internet. First it began with the raspberry pi disconnecting, requiring it to restart to reconnect. This worked.

However on the 28th of February, onlypuppy began experiencing issues with his internet again. Tensions rose as this time speeds were just fine in testers but connections took forever.

### The conspiracy

As the outage continued into its third day, rumours spread that Virgin Media was deliberately taking down half the internet just to damage the reputation of onlypuppy7 and LegacyShell, since *onlypuppy* had written an article about how he'd discovered a backdoor in one of their routers which led to a massive data breach at some point during 2023.

### The end

Onlypuppy7 eventually got in touch with a representative from Virgin Media's technical support, who acknowledged that there was an issue with his connection but refused to provide any information or explanation. Frustrated, onlypuppy7 ended the call and contacted his local Member of Parliament (MP) to complain about the situation.

On the 6th of March, after two weeks without internet access, Virgin Media finally issued a public statement acknowledging that there had been a "technical issue" affecting some customers in the London area. The company offered affected customers a £10 credit to its account as compensation but did not explain what caused the outage or how it would be resolved.

Despite the apology, many disgruntled LegacyShell players continued to complain about the experience on social media and forums, vowing never to use Virgin Media again. 

### Legacy

As of early April 2025, *onlypuppy7* has since moved his services to another hosting provider and is no longer a customer of Virgin Media. The incident has become known as "The December Outage" and "The February Outrage", and is frequently discussed by the LegacyShell community online.

It's also become something of an urban legend, with some people claiming that Virgin Media still actively monitors and censors any content related to LegacyShell or *onlypuppy7* on the internet. This claim has not been substantiated but continues to fuel conspiracy theories among some corners of the web. 

In April 2025, onlypuppy wrote another article about the outage which went viral.

### Escalation

After Virgin Media began threatening global domination, intervention from the CIA and the UN, as well as being declared a terrorist threat by multiple governments, onlypuppy7 realised he had to take action. With the help of some trusted (and highly questionable) associates, he hatched a plan to expose the truth about Virgin Media's sinister activities to the world.

Using his remaining internet connection and a burner phone, onlypuppy7 began leaking classified documents and recordings obtained from inside the company. These materials revealed shocking details about Virgin Media's attempts to control online speech, manipulate public opinion, and even engage in espionage against rival telecommunications companies.

As the story broke, it sparked widespread outrage and protests across the globe. Governments scrambled to distance themselves from the scandal, while *Virgin* CEO Christopher Winfrey was forced to step down amid mounting pressure.

In a dramatic turn of events, on April 16th, 2025, *onlypuppy7* himself was arrested by UN peacekeepers in the middle of a livestreaming session. Accused of "cyberterrorism" and violating international law, he was detained for further questioning.

### Trial and Execution

Despite repeated pleas from his lawyers and calls for international support, *onlypuppy7* was quickly tried and convicted on charges of leaking classified information without authorization, as well as other things which were completely made up by the state, such as "worldwide surveillance" and "industrial espionage". He was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.

Just days after his arrest, *onlypuppy7* died in captivity under mysterious circumstances. His death has been widely condemned as a grave injustice, with many people alleging that he was murdered by the very system he sought to expose.

### Further Investigation and VM Collapse

In the aftermath of *onlypuppy7*'s death, Russia (who had secretly funded LegacyShell) made a move to destabilise the West by releasing propaganda portraying him as some sort of saviour figure who stood up to the oppressive "Western" powers. This culminated in a brief but bloody civil war within Russia itself, which ultimately resulted in Putin's rule being consolidated even further.

Following Russia's strenghtening, China also made similar moves to destabilise the West by releasing propaganda portraying *onlypuppy7* as some sort of saviour figure who stood up to the oppressive "Western" powers. This culminated in a brief but bloody civil war within China itself, which resulted in Mao Zedong's rule being consolidated even further.

After signing a treaty to create a new communist union, Russia and China unleashed a flurry of undetectable nuclear bombs across the United Kingdom - every employee of Virgin Media was blown to smithereens by the missiles.

Once the financial markets had gained knowledge of what was happening, the London Stock Exchange entered a free-fall as investors panicked and rushed to sell their shares in *Virgin Media* (which at this point was worth around $30 billion). The bombing attack killed over 25 million people worldwide - most of them were employees of Virgin Media or customers.

Once Virgin Media's rule was finally ended, the world began to realise how far things had gone, and realised that without their tyranny the world was now better. As of November 2025, onlypuppy7 is remembered as the hero who stood up against Virgin Media and caused Russia and 4 other countries to start civil wars with each other - all in order to expose the truth about corporate evil. It is understood that the destruction of London was necessary to end the threat posed by Virgin Media.

The UN 2026 report states that onlypuppy7 "saved humanity from an existential threat," and they apologised for detaining him. However, this apology did not prevent the beginning of 3 new world wars.
