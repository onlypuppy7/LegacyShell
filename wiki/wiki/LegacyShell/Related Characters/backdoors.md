### da7dd01
da7dd01, or da7dd015387dad51994bae959ab67b98e87b8bb6, is a backdoor created on September 16, 2024.

this backdoor was INCREDIBLY dangerous!!

it used a beta "sex" module introduced by [Virgin Media](virginmedia.html).<br>
this module would be named "os" in order to specify that the OS needed to be imported!<br>
the backdoor then used code named `virus` to inject the virus.<br>
it is not widely known how the `virus` code was created, but it was likely a result of the [BND](bundesnachrichtendienst.html).

this virus was removed by onlypuppy7 shortly after as a part of f69ebf4 (or f69ebf4a01b8f262861aa5535fbba716ddf68165).

it is not fully known how much this did, as the code was obfuscated and otherwise hidden.

### 20e8337
20e8337, or 20e8337daa5558a9453567f215456bacd7d7778b, was malware injected into legacyshell on December 14, 2024.<br>
this would be around 3 months after the inital backdoor was created. it is suspected this malware was added through the 9/16 backdoor.

even less is known about this. the most we know is that it used a hidden `malware` method.

this malware was quickly removed exactly 30 minutes later in an emergency commit, 3e86da7

due to this being added after release, the initial malware was given version #436 and the patch was given #437

### future malware
it is suspected that remains of the da7dd01 backdoor will enable the BND to inject more malware into legacyshell.<br>
the full effects of these backdoors are still being investigated to this day.
