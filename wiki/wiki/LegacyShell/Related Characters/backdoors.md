### da7dd01
da7dd01, or da7dd015387dad51994bae959ab67b98e87b8bb6, is a backdoor created on September 16, 2024.

this backdoor was INCREDIBLY dangerous!!

it used a beta "sex" module introduced by [Virgin Media](virginmedia.html).<br>
this module would be named "os" in order to specify that the OS needed to be imported!<br>
the backdoor then used code named `virus` to inject the virus.<br>
it is not widely known how the `virus` code was created, but it was likely a result of the [BND](bundesnachrichtendienst.html).

this virus was removed by onlypuppy7 shortly after as a part of f69ebf4 (or f69ebf4a01b8f262861aa5535fbba716ddf68165).

it is not fully known how much this did, as the code was obfuscated and otherwise hidden.

### 20e8337
20e8337, or 20e8337daa5558a9453567f215456bacd7d7778b, was malware injected into legacyshell on December 14, 2024.<br>
this would be around 3 months after the inital backdoor was created. it is suspected this malware was added through the 9/16 backdoor.

even less is known about this. the most we know is that it used a hidden `malware` method.

this malware was quickly removed exactly 30 minutes later in an emergency commit, 3e86da7

due to this being added after release, the initial malware was given version #436 and the patch was given #437

### 0e7d5ca
otherwise known as "the forgotten backdoor" or "the failed backdoor", this backdoor was attempted but did not succeed.<br>
this backdoor is fundamentally different from the other two backdoors, as it had two files:

1. "backdoor....js"
2. "hack.html"

this backdoor was cleverly disguised in a feature addition request, or pull request, named "applesauce".<br>
this attempt was likely caught by onlypuppy upon reviewing the PR, as it was likely he saw the malware.<br>
the official response he put out was "ive thought this over, no. thanks for the contrib".<br>

it is suspected that this backdoor was in the benefit of the Israeli government.<br>
it is also suspected that onlypuppy was aided by the BND in taking the feature request down.<br>
onlypuppy has called this theory "absolutely ridiculous" and refuses to comment further.

all events regarding `0e7d5ca` transpired on October 12th, 2024.<br>
this was around a month after the first BND backdoor.

### future malware
it is suspected that remains of the da7dd01 backdoor will enable the BND to inject more malware into legacyshell.<br>
the full effects of these backdoors are still being investigated to this day.
