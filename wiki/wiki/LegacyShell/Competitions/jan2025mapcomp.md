|Name/Creator|Gallery|Scorings|Notes|
|------------|-------|--------|-----|
|The Colosseum<br>by Lotex|<img src="./Colosseum.png" alt="Colosseum" width="40%">|Creativity: 4/5<br>Playability: 5/5<br>Design: 5/5<hr>Total: 14/15|A very nice arena, which could be perfect for potential league games, with great angles for spectators to watch out of harm's way.|
|Egg Org's Castle<br>by Lotex|<img src="./Screenshot 2025-02-11 181608.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-11 181608" width="40%">|Creativity: 4/5<br>Playability: 2/5<br>Design: 5/5<hr>Total: 11/15|Although being too big to reasonably put into pubs, the scenery and paths in this map are very detailed and are fascinating to walk through.|
|Egglands<br>by Lotex|<img src="./Screenshot 2025-02-11 181737.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-11 181737" width="40%">|Creativity: 4/5<br>Playability: 4/5<br>Design: 3/5<hr>Total: 11/15|Seemingly based off Skywars maps, this turns Shell's map themes into a set of islands. It keeps most of the action concentrated, but a few elements seem haphazardly placed.|
|Red Shift<br>by Seq|<img src="./SeqRedShift.png" alt="SeqRedShift" width="40%">|Creativity: 2/5<br>Playability: 4/5<br>Design: 4/5<hr>Total: 10/15|This map has cool theming, jumps and a focused design.|
|Pokemon Arena<br>by yurayura|<img src="./Pokemon.png" alt="Pokemon" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 3/5<br>Design: 4/5<hr>Total: 10/15|A simple yet striking design with enough obstacles to give the player a good degree of freedom in strategy.|
|Spooky Graveyard<br>by DST Gamer|<img src="./Graveyard.png" alt="Graveyard" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 2/5<br>Design: 4/5<hr>Total: 9/15|Looks great, has a nice maze, but very flat...|
|Suspended Jungle<br>by Kẹc|<img src="./Jungle.png" alt="Jungle" width="40%">|Creativity: 4/5<br>Playability: 2/5<br>Design: 4/5<hr>Total: 9/15|The idea of a floating jungle is quite novel!|
|Legacy Arena<br>by lemme mewing|<img src="./LegacyArena.png" alt="LegacyArena" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 3/5<br>Design: 3/5<hr>Total: 9/15|A nice arena stylistically, if a little similar to existing ones such as Space Arena.|
|Heggven<br>by lemme mewing|<img src="./Heggven.png" alt="Heggven" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 3/5<br>Design: 3/5<hr>Total: 9/15|A perfectly simple map with what I can only summise as Heaven and Hell on each corner.|
|Squileggcy<br>by Kẹc|<img src="./Squileggcy.png" alt="Squileggcy" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 2/5<br>Design: 3/5<hr>Total: 8/15|An interesting idea but has a lot of empty space, very impressive lettering however!|
|Legacy Kingdom<br>by Kẹc|<img src="./LegacyKingdom.png" alt="LegacyKingdom" width="40%">|Creativity: 3/5<br>Playability: 2/5<br>Design: 2/5<hr>Total: 7/15|Although it looks nice from afar, there isn't much gameplay here.|
