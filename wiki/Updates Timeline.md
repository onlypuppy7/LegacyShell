# Shell Update Videos, Dates and Archives
## __Key:__
- Version:
  - [hyperlink](https://example.com/): archive of the site
- Date
  - [hyperlink](https://example.com/): evidence of the date
  - ranges mean the known range of dates of occurance (wayback machine/archive.today)
- Video links:
  - **bold = shows ui**
  - *italics = streamed*
  - ~~striked = version unconfirmed~~ this means that I don't know for sure, and just the date matches up.
- - late upload indicates that the version shown in the video doesn't match up with the upload date

> **FYI: Dates are NOT accurate to the exact time of release (unless they are linked, in which case the link goes to evidence), but are general guides of timescale.**
